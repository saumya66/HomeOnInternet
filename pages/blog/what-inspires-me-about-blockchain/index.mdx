Sometimes I wonder, how beautiful the world would be if it was one. No country but just Earth. No nationality but just Humans. No wars but just ambitious goals for the future of Humanity.
<br/>
Earlier I found no solution to it, unless we go to a different planet. But blockchain & decentralization pave the way for it. It removes the boundaries which have been unfortunately created in the past. Decentralization removes all these established centers. Web3 removes the data-hungry centers, residing on the web. Crypto removes the invisible borders created by governments. It just opens up everything, and forces us to think of the world again from the first principle. Finding what has gone wrong and how to fix it. And most importantly how to give the power back to an individual.
<br/>
In fact, I was reading about the Internet recently, especially how it began. And when I read this statement - "Internet is decentralized.", it made so much sense. No one owns the internet but many do. That is the definition of Decentralization. This is very much the reason why everyone loved it & still do. I and you can own a piece of it right now by buying a domain. It gave freedom to an individual.
<br/>
I admire the men who laid those physical wires around the earth to make the internet a reality. Now, it's our time to lay the blockchains. Not because it's hype or the next big thing, but because it's necessary. And if it ultimately sets us up for a better future, I want to contribute to that.
